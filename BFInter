1. Wait vs waithidden

	wait
	The wait command behaves the same as the run command, except that it waits for
	the completion of the process or program before continuing.
	Syntax
	wait <command line>

	Example
	wait "scandskw.exe"
	Runs the scandskw program and waits for the program to complete before
	continuing with the action script. The use of quotes is recommended practice, and
	necessary if there are spaces in the file name.

	waithidden
	This command is similar to the runhidden command and uses CreateProcess to
	execute a command in a hidden window. It hides the window by setting the
	STARTUPINFO dwFlag to STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW and setting
	wShowWindow to SW_HIDE. This action waits for the completion of the process
	before continuing with subsequent action commands.
	Syntax
	waithidden <command line>
	Examples
	waithidden "{pathname of regapp "notepad.exe"}"
	waithidden "c:\winnt\ftp.exe" ftp.myurl.net
	waithidden wscript /e:vbs x.vbs arg1 arg2
	These examples show how you might run a script in a hidden window and pass it
	some arguments. Quotes around the command line are recommended, and
	necessary if there are spaces in the file names.

2. Check file existense (relevance)

	exists file "xyz" of folder "c:\"

	exists file "C:\TransactionTree\eReceipts\TTProcess\TTProcessNet.exe" whose (version of it < "5.1.0.5")

3. Find a file in the entire machine with an extension eg. "*.exe" and find display it's location

	pathnames of it whose (name of it contains ".exe") of decendents of folders of drive whose (type of it = "DRIVE_FIXED")

4. Files generated for software inventory upload after scan and location
C:\Program Files (x86)\BigFix Enterprise\BES Client\LMT\CIT

5. BESAdminDebugOut.txt location
C:\Users\{USERNAME}\AppData\Local\BigFix\BESAdminDebugOut.txt

When BESAdmin is invoked by a Fixlet (or run by the LocalSystem user), the log file is
C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\BigFix\BESAdminDebugOut.txt

6. BFI Scanner install location

Windows: C:\Program Files\tivoli\cit 
UNIX: /opt/tivoli/cit 

7. Software Distribition: Embed URL in relevance and download/Pre-cache on the target machine
